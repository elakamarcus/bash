Optical imager poised to improve diagnosis and treatment of dry eye disease
Researchers have developed a new non-invasive optical imaging system that promises to improve diagnosis and treatments for dry eye disease. Dry eye, which often causes irritation and blurred vision, occurs when there is instability in the inner layer of the tear film that protects the outside of the eye.

Next-generation single-photon source for quantum information science
Over the last two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the field of quantum information science. Scientists are capitalizing on the strange nature of quantum mechanics to solve difficult problems in computing and communications, as well as in sensing and measuring delicate systems. One avenue of research in this field is optical quantum information processing, which uses photons—tiny particles of light that have unique quantum properties.

Anesthetizing fish may affect research outcomes
Fish use colorful patterns to signal to each other, including advertising for mates and warding off rivals. Studying these colors, especially in small and squirmy species, sometimes entails anesthetizing and photographing the fish to obtain color measurements from digital images.

Research shows the 'magic range' of twisted bilayer graphene is larger than previously expected
In materials science and quantum physics, flat bands and correlated behaviors within the "magic angle" twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) has sparked significant interest, although many of its properties face intense debate.  In a new report published in Science Advances, Emilio Codecido and colleagues in the departments of physics and materials science in the U.S. and Japan observed both superconductivity and a Mott-like insulator state in a tBLG device with a twist angle approximating 0.93 degrees. This angle was 15 percent smaller than the magic angle computed (∼ 1.1°) in previous studies. The study revealed the "magic" range of tBLG to be larger than previously expected. The work provided a wealth of new information to decipher the strong quantum phenomena within tBLG devices for applications in quantum physics.

Researchers find antibiotic resistant genes prevalent in groundwater
With climate change comes increasing water shortages, and potentially longer periods of drought. As policymakers look urgently to wastewater recycling to stem the gap in water resources, the question is— how best to reuse water and ensure public safety. New and emerging contaminants like antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) pose a potential hazard to public safety and water security. One concern is the spread of ARGs through the water system and an increase in development of antibiotic-resistant super bugs.

New 3-D imaging technology maps Scottish coral reefs
Newly developed 3-D imaging technology has allowed scientists to map an area of cold-water coral reefs off the coast of Scotland to see whether it has recovered since being declared a Marine Protected Area 16 years ago. The images show that in areas of the Darwin Mounds that had been heavily trawled, coral growth is still very sparse, and there has been no real recolonization. However, healthy coral growth was found in parts that had only been minimally damaged by bottom trawling, indicating that marine conservation measures are most effective when they are put in place before damage occurs. The team also discovered a large amount of plastic waste snagged on the coral.

Molecular hydrogen becomes semimetallic at pressures above 350 GPa
